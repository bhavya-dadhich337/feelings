                            I’ve been thinking about writing this letter for a while now, and even though it’s taken me
                            some time to gather my thoughts, I feel like the time has finally come to express how I
                            truly feel. 💗💗

                            From the very first time we spoke, there was something about you that captivated me. Your
                            kindness, your smile, and the way you make even the simplest moments feel special 💕🫂. I've come
                            to cherish them all. As we’ve gotten to know each other, I’ve realized that what I feel for
                            you goes far beyond admiration.🌹🌹

                            You’re someone I look forward to talking to, someone who brings light into my life, even on
                            the quiet days. And as we’ve shared conversations and memories, my feelings for you have
                            grown into something deeper—something I can’t ignore anymore.🌸🌸

                            So here I am, being honest with you, because you deserve nothing less. I’ve fallen for you 💝💖.
                            I find myself thinking about you more often than I ever expected. And while I know this may
                            be unexpected, I couldn’t keep these feelings to myself any longer.❤️❤️

                            I don’t know where this will take us, but I’d love the chance to explore it together. No
                            matter what, you will always hold a special place in my heart, but I hope, in time, that
                            place could become something more 🌙💘

                            Do you love me as I do but If not please please be with me as a friend and don’t break this bond...... ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹

                            With all my heart,
                            Bhavya Dadhich

<!-- Heyy !! How are you, I hope you are doing fine.  I want to tell you
something from a long time but I was not sure how would you react but my gut feelings says that I should say this to you as soon as possible. I don't know if it hurts you but I have to say it else I Will regret it for my
whole life and please do not make fun of my feelings by telling it to
anyone or spreading any rumours, etc. So are you ready to listen !!. Actually I was too
nervous to tell you face to face, so I decided a different way by making a website for you.
I have written every line of code with my hands just for you. When I saw you for the first
the first time, I thought you are the my type of girl which I was looking for, so I started
to observe your nature, personality, etc. and I was totally impressed.
I noticed that you are a perfect girl which I was looking for. Your eyes, your smile, your
nature, your personality, your kindness, your conversational skills, you are a perfect
10/10, with time we started talking on instagram everyday. You started to tell me your secrets and I was very happy. I was putting efforts, and prayed to god everyday for you. Now, I want to say that, huh!! I Love You ❤️.... Do you love me too ???.... I don't know what would be your reply but... If you are not interested to be in a relationship with me, can we just
be friends ❤️‍🩹 best friends and If you are too angry with that too, make me your brother but please don't break this bond 🥹. I respect girls too much. I hope you understand my
feelings and if you are not happy with it please forgive me... Thank You for reading my
letter patiently..... Byeee !!!!.... -->
